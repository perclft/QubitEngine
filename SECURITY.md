# Security Policy

I am not sure if I am being honest guys. I kinda just told gemini what to do when designing it.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Any vulnerability reports please just post in the discussions or contribute thanks.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
